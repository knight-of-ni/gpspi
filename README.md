# GPSPI - A Raspberry Pi GPS Photo Logger

This project was conceived while hiking the Saguaro National Park in Tuscon, Arizona. The idea was to take a photo every X feet traveled, and embed the GPS coordinates into the photo's exif data. A separate csv file, containing the GPS coordinates and additional information, is created.

The saved data can be retrieved over a builtin wifi access point.

Once retrieved, the saved data can then be uploaded to an online mapping tool, such as Google [My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps).

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/knight-of-ni/gpspi/wiki) for assembly instructions.

NOTE: This project is still in a testing stage. Please report problems. See [Issue #1](https://github.com/knight-of-ni/gpspi/issues/1) for a list of planned features and improvements.
